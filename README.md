## 🚀 Overview  
OnChainAid leverages blockchain technology to solve critical inefficiencies in traditional humanitarian aid systems. By implementing **VeChain's supply chain tracking** capabilities and **Ethereum-based smart contracts**, this platform ensures **full transparency**, **fraud prevention**, and **real-time accountability** in aid distribution.

---

## 🧩 Problem  
Traditional aid systems suffer from:  
- Lack of visibility into fund usage  
- Corruption/diversion of resources  
- Slow, bureaucratic distribution processes  
- Difficulty verifying aid delivery  

---

## 🔐 Blockchain Solutions  
### Immutable Audit Trail  
Every transaction (donations, distributions) is recorded on **VeChain's blockchain**, creating an unalterable record of aid flow from donors to recipients.

### Smart Contract Automation  
Funds are released automatically when predefined conditions are met (e.g., GPS verification of disaster zones, receipt confirmation via recipient biometrics).

### IoT Integration  
VeChain's partnership with IoT devices allows physical goods (food, medical supplies) to be tracked in real-time, ensuring proper delivery and reducing theft.

### Donor Empowerment  
Donors can trace their contributions using a unique transaction hash, viewing exactly how their funds are used via an on-chain dashboard.

### Decentralized Verification  
Recipients and local NGOs can submit proof of need via mobile devices, with smart contracts validating claims using geolocation data and AI analysis.
